\section{Selected Projects}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{2016}
     {Project Lead}
     {"bitQuit" -- IoT Smoking Abatement Tool}

The bitQuit is a smart cigarette case (and Android app) that helps smokers limit and track cigarette use. The case locks for a programmable interval, and custom switches count cigarettes remaining. These data are transmitted via BLE to the app, where smoking history and remaining wait time are viewable.

\item{2016}
     {Front-End, Firmware Developer}
     {"Display-o-Matic" e-Paper Tie}
     
This novelty tie has a built-in e-paper display which displays arbitrary patterns/images. The user selects image thumbnail on touchscreen linked to Gumstix Verdex board. Selection is conveyed via Bluetooth to Raspberry Pi, which flashes new image to display via GPIO pins.

\item{2016}
     {CUDA Developer}
     {High Performance FFT}
     
Using a naive FFT as a baseline, high-performance methods (code motion, loop unrolling, pThreads, OpenMP) were applied in various combinations to achieve a range of speedup. Also wrote a CUDA implementation to utilize GPU parallelism.
     
\item{2015}
     {Back-End Developer}
     {"JAMs" Playlist Application}

This Java-based playlist app queries and updates a database of playlists/songs based on popularity. Searches feature fast autocomplete using a Prefix Tree, and popularity ranking is maintained with a modified BST. UI implemented with JavaFX.

\item{2015}
     {Researcher}
     {C Vulnerability Static Analysis Tool}
    
Inspired by usr/bin/rsh vulnerability allowing addition of user to sudoers, this tool batch scans source code for possible privilege escalation risks. Python web scraper was used to download OS X source code in bulk.

\item{2014}
     {Lead Developer}
     {"LEAP Legends" -- Android App}

Original hexagon-based game for Android. Board elements and game pieces are implemented with OOP principles to create a simple, yet deep two-player strategy experience.
